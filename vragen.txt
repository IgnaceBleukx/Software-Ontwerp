1. A cell needs to have different types of values (string, boolean, ...). Currently we implement this by using Generics: Value<Boolean>, ... Is this a good approach?
2. Is it necessary to have a association between Table and Cell? Isn't it enough to have Table -> Column or Row -> Cell?
3. Is it okay to just repaint the canvas after each mouse or keyboard event? Or can we assume that in the future other types of events might create the need to repaint?
4. How detailed should sequence diagrams be? Should they be a complete trace through our program of just be an interaction between USER and TABLR?
5. How much code coverage should we aim for when testing?
