TODO:

- !!!! In ListView regel 162 en 166 code uncommenten!!! EN in MyCanvasWindow regel 28

- Add a horizontal and vertical scrollbar
- User can resize subwindow  by draging its borders or its corners
- Moving title subwindow via title bar (al bijna ge√Ømplementeerd)
- Scrollbar is shown disabled if height of content is not greater than height of subwindow
- User can drag scroll button or click scrollbar above or below scroll button to scroll (oplossing: rechthoek boven en onder de scrollbar toevoegen)
- activated subwindow is distinguished visually from other subwindows
- If the active subwindow is closed, and any subwindows remain, of those subwindows the one that was active most recently becomes again the active subwindow.
